Rescue Santa's Ally

Sigh! Screams! Desolation! Bitterness! 
Mother Christmas is being held prisoner by a gang of thugs. They've contacted us and are demanding a ransom. As soon as the call came in, we activated our signal sensors to determine the caller's geographical position. Alas, they realized this and jammed the radio frequency, causing us to lose some signal snippets. Join us and help us reconstruct the missing parts of the signal in order to identify the kidnappers' location as quickly as possible. 

Mother Noel's life is at stake and in danger.
