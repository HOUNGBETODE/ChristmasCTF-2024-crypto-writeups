The magic ingredient

Base32 is the magic ingredient used by Santa Claus to wrap presents for little children, making them easier to unwrap on arrival. This year, it has mysteriously disappeared. Concerned about the future of Christmas, a reindeer hastily concocted a substitute for Base32. Father Christmas would like to know if the new ingredient really does simplify gift unwrapping.
