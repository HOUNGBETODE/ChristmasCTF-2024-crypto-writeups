I promised Santa to be good and bright this year. So I went to Beijing to work hard. I did so well that all the Chinese liked me. One of them sent me a congratulatory note, but I couldn't make out what it meant. Is it raw Chinese or garbage? I don't know. 
Please help me discover the note to show Santa Claus that I do deserve a Christmas present.
