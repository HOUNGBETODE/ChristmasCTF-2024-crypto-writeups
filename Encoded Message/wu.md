- The hint added on the second day was very explicit: __"This challenge is related to code competitions. Read the challenge description carefully and refer to the title to solve it"__.

- After reading the challenge description, we knew which programming platform to choose: **Kattis**.

- The title of the challenge is the same as the programming problem proposed on the platform.

- With a bit of daring and OSINT, we came across the following link: **__https://open.kattis.com/problems/encodedmessage__**.

- The aim was to get to grips with the problem, understand it and solve it if possible, in order to gain a better understanding of the encoding process.

- Then, based on this understanding, to write the decoding algorithm that will be used to solve the CTF challenge.

- By doing this, we figured out that the wish of Alex was : **My_b3l0v3d_R0s3_m4y_y0u_b3_my_gr34t3st_g1ft_th1s_X-m4s_4nd_m4y_I_b3_y0urs_F0r3v3r**.

- So, flag was : **CMCTF{My_b3l0v3d_R0s3_m4y_y0u_b3_my_gr34t3st_g1ft_th1s_X-m4s_4nd_m4y_I_b3_y0urs_F0r3v3r}**.
