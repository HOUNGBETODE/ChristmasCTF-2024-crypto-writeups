- Here, particular attention had to be paid to the image, its resolution and the pixels making it up.

- The image resolution is 8x84. What's more, it's made up exclusively of black and white pixels.

- A binary representation is therefore involved. And each pixelated line of the image represented a byte, i.e. an ascii character.

- We therefore had to extract the pixels from the image in the form of matrices, go through them line by line and make a binary correspondence: the black pixel for 0 and the white for 1 or vice versa

- Flag was : **CMCTF{7h3_tru3_5p1r17_0f_Chr1stm45_15_4b0u7_c4r1ng_&_5h4r1ng}**.
