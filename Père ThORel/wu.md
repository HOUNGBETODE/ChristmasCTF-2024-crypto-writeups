- Reading the challenge description, it's clear that a transformation has been applied to the original image, so we need to identify it.

- The title of the challenge indirectly refers to the transformation that has been applied: it's called **ROT ...**. The best-known encryption algorithms for **ROT** are __ROT 13__ and __ROT 47__. After a few tries, we realized that it was __ROT 47__.

- Decoding the image supplied via __ROT 47__, we end up with the original image containing the flag: **CMCTF{P3R3_N03l_4CR0b4T3_l0L!!!}**.
